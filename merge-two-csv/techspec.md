# Project Title: CSV Merge Script

## Objective:
To develop a Python script that merges two CSV files based on a common value in a specified column.

## Requirements:
1. The script should accept two input CSV files.
2. The user should specify the column name containing the common value for merging.
3. The script should merge the two CSV files based on the common value in the specified column.
4. The merged data should be written to a new CSV file.
5. Handle cases where the common value is not found in one of the files.
6. The script should be well-documented with comments explaining the functionality of each section.

## Deliverables:
1. Python script file (.py) implementing the CSV merge functionality.
2. Sample input CSV files for testing.
3. Detailed documentation explaining how to use the script and any dependencies required.

## Additional Considerations:
- The script should be designed to handle large CSV files efficiently.
- Error handling should be implemented to handle unexpected scenarios gracefully.
- Unit tests should be provided to ensure the correctness of the script.
- Consider providing options for customizing the output format or handling special cases.
